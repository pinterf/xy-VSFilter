# Change log:

## v3.2.0.809 (20240102)

Updates, fixes and some backports from Cyberbeing/xy-VSFilter by TheOneric, Masaiki and Cyberbeing

* Gracefully handle negative Encoding values
  more on this: https://github.com/pinterf/xy-VSFilter/commit/102897189902658ec68ef691eb3dd8d89f099985
* Update CSRI name
* Use distinct CSRI name and update CSRI version:
  Adjust the name so users can distinguish Cyberbeing/xy-VSFilter
  from pinterf/xy-VSFilter if builds from both are placed into Aegisubâ€™s csri directory
* fix: time shift when playing external sup files
* fix: close sup file and read stop time of sample
* Introduce LayoutRes{X,Y} script headers. See details here:
  https://github.com/pinterf/xy-VSFilter/commit/8a46df19666191f6fcaa44811123c34f165f358e

## v3.2.0.808 (20221116)
* Fix Possible unhandled exception in Masksub (https://github.com/pinterf/xy-VSFilter/issues/36)
* Fix: no more vertically flipped MaskSub result for RGB32
* remove latest scaling workaround
  More on that: https://github.com/pinterf/xy-VSFilter/pull/34

## v3.2.0.807 (20210522) - WIP
* fix: scale between subtitle and video on CWord (Masaiki) (Issue: frx and fry tags wrong scaling)

## v3.2.0.806 (20210412)

* proper WebVTT support fixes by adipose/MPC-HC

## v3.2.0.805 (20210412)

* WebVTT support, embedded subtitles as well.
  99% of it extracted from MPC-HC https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc, thanks to MPC-HC developers.
* Changed the Subtitles library timestamp to REFERENCE_TIME (64 bit) internally.
  For very-very long clips (use case: streaming) (slydiman)
* Fix: ASS subtitles: styles with space after their names would fail to work (MPC HC/BE + external XySubFilter)
  (report: MatiasMovie, solution by astiob)
* Various code syntax fixes (clang compiler)

## v3.2.0.804 (20210306 - pinterf)
* Add native YV16, YV24, P210 (YUV422P10) and P216 (YUV422P16) support.
  From TextSub Avisynth filter they even work.

## v3.2.0.803 (20210305 - pinterf)
* Source: new code base in new branch which finally works with Visual Studio 2019:\
  https://github.com/Cyberbeing/xy-VSFilter/tree/xy_sub_filter_rc5
* upstream:
  * (cyberbeing) Revert MPC-HC Tag Cache, restore xy Tag Cache
  
   Fixes a significant performance regression on certain SSA/ASS samples.
  * (jesec) subtitles, subpic: enable SSE2 unconditionally
     Target OS (10.0) required users to have SSE2
     It is meaningless to maintain backward compatibility
  * (jesec) Unicode conversion for file src/dsutil/DSUtil.cpp
     Remove support for DX7
  * (jesec) Rasterizer::Rasterize: use optimized memsetSSE2.
    Source: https://www.agner.org/optimize/
  * (cyberbeing) Add VS2019 environment
* Active branch changed to xy_sub_filter_rc5 on my (pinterf) side as well
* Avisynth plugin
  * re-add my changes from 2018
  * Add support for YV16
  * Throw error on unsupported formats
  * Avisynth plugin: keep frame properties when Avisynth+ interface is v8
* version set manually in src/filters/transform/vsfilter/version_in.h

## v3.2.0.802 (20181031)
* Change version numbering.
  
  Cyberbeing has released a patch for their original xy-VSFilter, their version stepped to v3.1.0.752
  
  Since I thought the project was full-dead, my version numbering kept - after a range skip - the original numbering.
  
  Now I'm changing my versioning scheme to 3.2.x.x to avoid possible future collision.
  
* Fix TextSub crash that could occur in rare circumstances (shssoichiro)

* Fix for SSA/ASS repositioning becoming permanently disabled after typesetting was displayed\
  (madshi -> Cyberbeing v3.1.0.752 7th October 2018)
  
* Add BT.2020 Support\
  (madshi -> Cyberbeing v3.1.0.751 27th September 2018)

## v3.1.0.801 (20180904)
* fix random crash in x64 build (address truncated to 32 bits, Rasterizer::Draw and Rasterizer::FillSolidRect were affected)
* XySubFilter.DLL now compiled with v141_xp toolset instead of v141 (like VSFilter.DLL)
* From upstream (madshi, Cyberbeing)
  * Fix a possible infinite loop in the Real Text subtitle parser on 64-bit
  * Fix external SRT subtitles with italic tag not being flagged as repositionable
  * Disable repositioning for SSA/ASS subtitles with default position level
  * Add setting to allow repositioning of SSA/ASS dialog

- v3.1.0.800 (20180411)
* Bring source to XySubFilter-3.1.0.746 level:\
  Apply file differences between Cyberbeing XySubFilter-3.1.0.746 (source from the release pack) \
  and xy-VSFilter 3.0.0.306 mod.
* make the source VS2017 compatible again
* make VSFilter work again as an Avisynth plugin
* Versioning: 3.1.0 prefix is kept, build number goes from 800 and up for my mod manually in src/filters/transform/vsfilter/version_in.h

## v3.0.0.400 (20180405) (work in February 2018)
* Get the last known xy-vsfilter version (3.0.0.306) which was still working as the Avisynth plugin.\
  https://github.com/Cyberbeing/xy-VSFilter/releases/tag/3.0.0.306\
  Plan: have a native 10/16 bit compatible Avisynth TextSub filter.\
* xy-vsfilter 3.0.0.306 rebuilt with Visual Studio 2017
* Avisynth+ headers
* Native support for YUV420P10 and YUV420P16 formats in Avisynth filter TextSub and probably VobSub.
  Internal conversion to and from P010 and P016 with SSE2 support
* Still doesn't work in any MT mode (I think): automatically registers itself as MT_SERIALIZED to prevent troubles
* Avisynth filter MaskSub: new pixel_type (default: "RGB32") parameter. Can be set to "YUV420P10" or "YUV420P16"
* Versioning: 3.0.0 prefix kept, build number goes from 400 and up for my mod manually in src/filters/transform/vsfilter/version_in.h
